2. If you haven't upgraded your nopCommerce website to version 3.9 already, then follow the instructions in the "nopCommerce_readme.txt".
3. Copy all the plugins for 3.9 to the Plugins folder of nopCommerce.
4. Start your site. If you have made any changes to the plugins in 3.8 then you need to merge them in the new version of the plugins.
