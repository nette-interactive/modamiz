When you purchase any of our plugins but you already have the Trial version istalled you need to replace the actual plugin .dll file with the new one.

NOTE: If you haven't made any modifications to the plugin css or cshtml files then we recommend you to update the whole plugin folder and not just the plugin .dll file. It is possible that we might have added new files since you have downloaded the trial version. So in this case you will be missing these files and the plugin may not work as expected.

WARNING: Do NOT uninstall the plugin as this will delete the data of the plugin from the database and you will have to set it up again.
If you have any problems removing the trial version please submit a ticket, so that we can advice.
